# Todotra
Todotra is a todo-tracker
## What it does:
Todotra is a terminal based todo-tracker, or a todo-list. It is my take on this classic programming project. Currently the program will load a list from file if it exists, you can then add tasks that need to be done, view tasks, and mark them as complete. Marking as complete will currently instantly remove the task from the program. When exiting the program, the list is saved to file.
## Why is it useful:
It is useful to keep track of your tasks that need being done.
## How can you use the program:
Simply download the todotra.py file and run it as a python script. the program will save the file containing the tasks to /home/usr/.todotra/todo_list.txt 
When using the program you can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, clear the tasks marked as completed and quit the program. Quitting will save the current list of tasks.
